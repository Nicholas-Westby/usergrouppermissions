Usergroup permissions - Umbraco 7 upgrade
====================
Started attempting to upgrade package to Umbraco 7.

So far have got everything upgraded, dialogs loading fine, data saving using petapoco. 

I don't think the permissions are copying to users but I have run out of  initial time so anyone interested feel free to pick this up and test / tweak. I will return to this ASAP as I will need for a client project in the near future.
